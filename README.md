Host discovery tool with high efficacy and efficiency.


Suite of several tools that you can autorun or have run individually.  This includes mainly tools for discovery, focusing on host discovery.  We are using some of the following tools:

1.  Nmap
2.  Masscan
3.  TBD
4.  TBD
5.  AppEnum (C1ph3rflux's baby)

We have built these specifically to generate custom discovery scans and then dedupe them to provide the most accurate output.

TODO:
-List is way too long at the moment, need to cleanup the Google Doc and move it here.
